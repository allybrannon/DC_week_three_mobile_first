        <h1>The Queen Bee- Grimm's Fairy Tales</h1>
        <p>Two kings' sons once went out in search of adventures, and fell into
            a wild, disorderly way of living, so that they never came home again.
            The youngest, who was called simpleton, set out to seek his brothers,
            but when at length he found them they mocked him for thinking that he
            with his simplicity could get through the world, when they two could
            not make their way, and yet were so much cleverer.
